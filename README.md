# Credit Card Fraud Detection - InfoaidTech Machine Learning Intern Task (aidTech_Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)

## Introduction

This machine learning project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised learning techniques. We aim to build a model that can effectively identify whether a credit card transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Load the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

We will begin by loading the credit card fraud detection dataset into our Python environment. The dataset contains transaction data, including features such as transaction amount, timestamp, and more.

### 2. Importing Pandas Library

We will use the Pandas library for data manipulation and preprocessing, which is essential for preparing the dataset for model training.

### 3. Pre-processing the Dataset via Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before building the fraud detection model, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. EDA includes tasks such as handling missing data, checking data distributions, and understanding the characteristics of fraudulent transactions.

### 4. Splitting the Dataset

To train and evaluate our fraud detection model, we will split the dataset into training and testing sets. This division ensures that we can assess the model's performance accurately.

### 5. Selecting a Classifier

We will choose a classifier for this binary classification task. Common choices include Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), which have proven effective in fraud detection scenarios.

### 6. Training the Model

Using the training dataset, we will train our selected classifier to learn patterns in legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The goal is to create a model capable of distinguishing between the two.

### 7. Evaluate Model

To assess the performance of our fraud detection model, we will use various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC curve. These metrics will help us understand how well the model can identify fraudulent transactions.
